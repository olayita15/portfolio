	<h1>Portfolio</h1>
	<p>This portfolio was created using Django, a powerful web framework that allows for fast and efficient web development. The design of the portfolio was created using CSS libraries such as Codepen and Bootstrap, which provide a great set of tools to create responsive and visually appealing web pages.</p>
	<p>In the backend, a language switcher library for Django has been implemented and configured to allow for seamless language switching on the website.</p>
	<p>The project structure is organized in a clear and intuitive way, which can be seen in the following folder structure:</p>

	<p>Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio!</p>
